MySQL Server (for database management)

Postman (for API testing)

Git (if cloning from a repository)

Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-folder>

2. Install Dependencies

npm init -y
npm install express cors mysql body-parser

3. Setup MySQL Database
